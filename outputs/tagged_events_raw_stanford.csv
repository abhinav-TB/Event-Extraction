the fourth time on Friday.Governor Vajubhai Vala administered the oath of office and secrecy to BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa at a ceremony at the Raj Bhavan.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was sworn-in.Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry is assuming office three days after the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) government with the defeat of the motion of confidence moved by chief minister H D Kumaraswamy in the assembly by 99-105 votes.In a sudden development on Friday morning, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa met Governor Vajubhai Vala to stake the claim and requested Governor Vajubhai Vala to administer the oath of office and secrecy, following which Governor Vajubhai Vala invited BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa to form Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry.Before sworn, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa said BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa would decide on members to be inducted into Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry after consulting party president Amit Shah.This is the fourth stint for BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa as the Chief Minister-- the last one was after the May 2018 Assembly polls, when BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa barely lasted three days after being sworn in.Yediyurappa:Comeback man who has surmounted the oddsFrom the humdrum existence as a government clerk and a hardware storeowner to becoming the chief minister for a fourth time, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa has navigated the choppy waters of politics with the consummate ease of a seasoned oarsman.The rare smile is back on BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's face as BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa took over as the chief minister, 14 months after BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa demitted the chief minister, unable to prove the majority in the assembly.In a repeat of sorts, it has not been an easy ascent to power for BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa this time too as a murky legal battle and weeks of political drama preceded BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's takeover.Losing power after having come so close, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was determined to regain the reins of power from H D Kumaraswamy, whose party JD(S) cobbled up a post poll alliance with Congress and managed to overthrow BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's three-day-old BJP government on May 19, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa had to resign as CM as BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa could not muster a majority after staking claim to form Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry on the ground that BJP had emerged as the single largest one.Another interesting element in BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's struggle to power this time is, this time is being seen as BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's last chance, considering BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's age and BJP's policy of retirement from electoral politics to BJP's's leaders who have crossed 75.A hardboiled RSS swayamsevak, 76-year-old Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yediyurappa joined the Hindu right organisation when BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was barely 15, and cut BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's political teeth in the Jana Sangh, BJP's's forerunner, in BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's hometown Shikaripura in Shivamogga district.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa became the Jana Sangh, the BJP's forerunner's his hometown Shikaripura in Shivamogga district taluk chief in the early 1970s.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S YediyurappaBENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's his hometown

unit president, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa has also served as opposition Leader in the assembly, member of Legislative Council, as also member of parliament.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa is known to have espoused the cause of farmers.A Bachelor of Arts, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa, worked as a clerk in the social welfare department before taking up a similar job at a rice mill in his hometown Shikaripura in Shivamogga district before BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa set up BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's hardware shop in Shivamogga district.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa married Maitradevi, daughter of the rice mill owner, where BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa worked, on March 5, 1967 and has two sons and three daughters.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa may have landed in the hot seat in 2004 when BJP's emerged as the single largest party, but Congress and JD(S) of former prime minister H D Deve Gowda formed an alliance, and a government was formed under Dharam Singh.Known for BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's political acumen, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa joined hands with Kumaraswamy, former prime minister H D Deve Gowda's son, in 2006 and brought down a government Dharam Singh after Dharam Singh was indicted by Lokayukta in an alleged mining scam.Under a rotational chief ministership arrangement, Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda's son became the CM and BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda's son's deputy.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa became CM for the first time in November 2007 but BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's term lasted just seven days as chief minister H D Kumaraswamy reneged on a power sharing pact and walked out of an alliance.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was made the chief minister once again after BJP's came to power in May 2018 but had to step down in July 2011 following BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's indictment by the then Lokayukta N Santosh Hegde in an illegal mining case.In the 2008 polls, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa led BJP to victory, and the first BJP's government in the south was formed under BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa.Soon controversies swirled around BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa over alleged abuse of office to favour BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's sons in allotment of land in Bengaluru and BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was forced to resign on July 31, 2011 following indictment by Lokayukta in an illegal mining scam.On October 15 2011, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa surrendered before the Lokayukta court after the Lokayukta court issued a warrant against BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa in connection with alleged land scams,and was in jail for a week.Sulking after having been made to quit, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa broke BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's decades-long association with the saffron party and formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha.However, ploughing a lonely furrow, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa failed to make the Karnataka Janata Paksha a force to reckon with in state politics but wrecked BJP's's chances of retaining power in the 2013 polls, winning six seats and polling about 10 per cent votes.As BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa faced an uncertain future and BJP's looked for a leader with a formidable reputation to lend BJP's's campaign the required heft ahead of the May 2018 Assembly polls, the two cosied up to each other, leading to the Karnataka Janata Paksha's merger with BJP's on January 9, 2014.In the May 2018 Assembly pollsLok Sabha , BJP's won 19 of Karnataka's 28 seats, won.Notwithstanding the corruption taint, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's status and clout grew in BJP's October 26, 2016, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa got a huge relief when a special CBI court acquitted BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's two sons and son-in-law in a Rs 40 crore illegal mining case, which had cost BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa the chief ministership in 2011.In January 2016, the Karnataka High Court quashed all 15 FIRs against BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa lodged by Lokayukta police under the Prevention of Corruption Act.In April 2016, BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa was appointed the state BJP chief for the fourth time.BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa, however, continued to be dogged by controversies, with the anti-corruption bureau launching proceedings against BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa in an alleged illegal land denotification case, which was stayed by the high court following BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa's plea.BJP's declared BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa BJP's's chief ministerial candidate in the 2018 assembly polls, ignoring the taunts by Congress.As the 2018 assembly polls threw up a hung verdict, with no party getting a clear majority in the 225-member House (including Speaker), the Governor invited BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa to form Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry and gave BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa 15 days to prove the majority.However,the Supreme Court asked BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa to prove the majority the 225-member House (including Speaker) following a plea by Congress challenging invited.Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry BJP's collapsed on May 19, minutes before the scheduled trust vote, with BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa resigning in a tame anti-climax and hours later Kumaraswamy, Deve Gowda's son, was invited to form Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry.In the last over one year, BJP under BENGALURU — Karnataka BJP president B S Yediyurappa managed to keep Yediyurappa-led BJP ministry on tenterhooks as BJP's constantly feared poaching of MLAs by the saffron party.The resignation of 15 rebel Congress-JD(S) MLAs came as a blow to the newly formed JD(S)-Congress alliance and the newly formed JD(S)-Congress alliance collapsed losing the trust vote on July 23, paving the way for MLAs's return.",kill,https://kashmirobserver.net/2019/regional-news/yediyurappa-sworn-karnataka-cm-4th-time-45068,TO_BE_FILLED
