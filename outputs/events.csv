99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,"Overtourism has been covered in media and publications increasingly as a problem that stems from the very concept of travel, even if Overtourism encompasses just a small part of the very concept of travel."
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,"Overtourism is not only completely unsustainable, Overtourism is a growing problem that should be taken seriously."
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,"Policy responses to Overtourism are, in many cases, as clumsy and ill-considered as the policies which produced Overtourism in the first place."
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,Overtourism can negatively affect travelers’ sentiment as well as the small-scale sustainable tourism industry.
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,"Let us be clear from the outset: Overtourism does not result from ecotourism, and the principles of those who extol increasing tourism revenue to a destination at any cost are completely antithetical to those of ecotourism."
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,Overtourism—which in Overtourism—which in its simplest form is tourism that harms communities by overuse or destruction of resources through overcrowding's simplest form is tourism that harms communities by overuse or destruction of resources through overcrowding—stems from a lack of concern about destination community health and welfare.
99,Ecotourism Is The Solution To Overtourism,2019-07-20T01:30:00.000Z,"Again, a lack of concern about destination community health and welfare is entirely the opposite of the fundamental tenet of ecotourism."

287,Donald Trump And The Strangling Of Persia,2019-07-22T12:48:07.000Z,The central point of conflict in Iran was over who should control and acquire the benefits of Iran's vast oil reserves.

287,Donald Trump And The Strangling Of Persia,2019-07-22T12:48:07.000Z,"Toppling his 21-year-old son, Mohammad Reza was seen as national liberation.Iranians are viewing current American foreign policy through the prism of Iranians's historical experience."

516,New Audio Shows UK Could Not Prevent Iran Takeover Of Tanker,2019-07-22T06:46:48.000Z,LONDON — The release Sunday of an audio recording has shed new light on the seizure of a British-flagged tanker at the hands of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as tensions flare in the strategic Strait of Hormuz.an audio recording shows that a British frigate was too far away from a British-flagged tanker to keep a British-flagged tanker from being diverted into an Iranian port despite UK efforts to keep a British-flagged tanker from being boarded.
516,New Audio Shows UK Could Not Prevent Iran Takeover Of Tanker,2019-07-22T06:46:48.000Z,"On an audio recording, a stern-voiced British naval officer insists that a British-flagged tanker must be allowed to sail through the strategic Strait of Hormuz even as Iranian paramilitary forces demand — successfully — that a British-flagged tanker change course.an audio recording shows how Iran’s's once mighty Royal Navy was unable to prevent a British-flagged tanker seizure, which has been condemned by Iran’s and Iran’s's European allies as Britain and its European allies continue to call for a reduction of tensions in the strategic Strait of Hormuz.The free flow of traffic through the strategic Strait of Hormuz is of critical importance to the world’s energy supplies because one-fifth of all global crude exports pass through the strategic Strait of HormuzIran’s .In an audio recording, an Iranian officer can be heard telling a British-flagged tanker to change course, saying: “a British-flagged tanker obey, a British-flagged tanker will be safe.” “Alter a British-flagged tanker's course to 360 degrees immediately, over,” an Iranian officer says, adding that a British-flagged tanker is wanted for security reasons.A British naval officer from a British frigate is heard telling a British-flagged tanker, that a British-flagged tanker's passage must be allowed."

519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"said has, however, generated a simultaneous interest and anxiety in Kashmir."
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"There is interest as the BJP with the BJP's  integrationist agenda on Kashmir is talking about a permanent solution, which is seen as an indirect acknowledgement of a  problem in Kashmir, something the BJP normally denies exists."
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,And there is anxiety as no one is sure about the BJP intention to adopt a political approach towards the turmoil in Kashmir and work towards a political resolution.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,And understandably so.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"In the BJP's last term in the government,  there was  no political outreach towards Kashmir."
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,Government response was  invariably militaristic in nature.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,So what is his really talking about?
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"Is his talking about a resolution in a matter-of-fact manner, meaning nothing more than a stabilization of the situation?"
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"a resolution in a matter-of-fact manner, meaning nothing more than a stabilization of the situation could mean tougher security measures to quell the protests and the stone throwing."
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,A scorched earth policy to crush the militancy.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,A plan perhaps to  eliminate the active local and foreign militants over a specific period of time.

519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"But the truth is even if the centre to a significant extent achieves the centre's ambitious security objectives in the Valley within a specific timeframe, it would make little redeeming difference to the state of affairs."

519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,One such anticipated measure and which has been a source of deep paranoia in Kashmir is the centre attempt to revoke or dilute J&K remaining constitutional safeguards to achieve    integration of Kashmir into India.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,Many people even speculate about a bid  to undo the Article 370 or one of the Article 370's critical features like the Article 35A that protects J&K's state subject laws whereby outsiders can’t become Kashmir's citizens.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,Or is there any political roadmap up the centre's sleeve?
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,One can’t really say.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"So far the BJP under the Prime Minister Narenda Modi has given little indication that the BJP under the Prime Minister Narenda Modi even considers Kashmir an issue that needs a political settlement and has chosen to treat the unrest in Kashmir as a law and order issue to be quelled by the use of force and the development.But not long in the past,  the BJP under the Prime Minister Narenda Modi was working towards a bilateral solution with Pakistan along Musharraf’s four point formula."
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,It was the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had begun the promising negotiations with Musharraf’s which were later followed up by the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
519,A Kashmir Solution,2019-07-22T12:48:01.000Z,"The process had nearly culminated into a Kashmir solution by the end of 2007 when Musharraf’s's sudden loss of power and later on the Mumbai attacks  aborted a Kashmir solution.However, there is a lot that has happened since."
